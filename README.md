## AirBnB_clone

This is my first full stack project on ALX it involves building a simple AirBnB clone web app.

The language used is python

## Operation: 

The first part is to build the console which builds the backbone of our project.

The console will be able to perform basic operations like creating new objects, updating and destroying objects

## Description :house:

HolbertonBnB is a full web application, integrating database storage, front-end interfacing and a back-end API.

## Console :computer:
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of the application. 
It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application.

###Usage of the console

The Holberton console can run both interactively and non-interactivrly.

To run in non-interactive mode, pipe any commands(s) into an execution of the file 'console.py' at the command line.


## Console Commands

The console supports the following commands:

    **create**
        * usage: `create <class>`

This creates a new instance of a given class. The class ID is printed and the instance is saved to the file `file.json`

```
