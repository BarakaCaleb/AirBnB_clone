## AirBnB_clone

This is my first full stack project on ALX it involves building a simple AirBnB clone web app.

The language used is python

## Operation: 

The first part is to build the console which builds the backbone of our project.

The console will be able to perform basic operations like creating new objects, updating and destroying objects
